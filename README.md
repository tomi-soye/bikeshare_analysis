US Bikeshare Analysis

About The Project
This is the third project of an Udacity course titled Programming for Data Science with Python. This project uses knowledge of Python's libraries- Pandas and Numpy, to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Statistic information were retrieved from the database. The user is able filter the information by city, month and weekday.

Resources
To complete the project, I used my knowledge which I gained over the course of studying the Python Foundation Nanodegree Program on Udacity. When confused, i got help from these source(s):

Google
Python documentation
Stackoverflow
Pandas Documentation
For running small snippets of code, i made use of the Jupyter Notebook
